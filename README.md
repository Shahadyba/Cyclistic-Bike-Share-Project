# Cyclistic-Bike-Share-Project

Hi!

Recently I Finished the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Program on Coursera. As part of this course, I completed a data analysis case study to showcase the conceptual skills I learned throughout the course. 

For this project, I used Python for Data Preparation, Analysis, and tableau for Visualization.

## **Scenario**
Cyclistic is a bike-share company. It has two pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as *Casual riders*. Customers who purchase annual memberships are *Annual members*.


The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. The goal is to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics.

However, As junior data analyst my Assignment is to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.
